# QML Meta Kaggle

**Repository:** `_prk10/qml_meta‑kaggle`  
**Description:** A project containing Q‑learning (QML) analysis on Kaggle datasets, featuring a Jupyter notebook, PDF report, and visual artifacts.

## Contents

- `qml‑meta‑kaggle.ipynb` – A Jupyter notebook presenting the core Q‑learning exploration, experimentation, and results.
- `QNALYSIS.pdf` – A PDF report summarizing findings and analysis from the notebook.
- `visuals/` – Directory holding visual outputs (charts, plots, etc.) generated during analysis.

*(Note: `.DS_Store` files are system artifacts and should not be tracked in version control.)*

## Overview

This repository illustrates the application of Q‑learning—reinforcement learning's value‑based method—to Kaggle datasets. The Jupyter notebook guides you through data loading, algorithm implementation, parameter tuning, evaluation, and visualization. The PDF report encapsulates the analytical insights and outcomes. Visuals generated throughout the process are stored in the `visuals/` directory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- Python 3.7 or higher  
- Jupyter installed (`jupyterlab` or `notebook`)  
- Required libraries: commonly such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, and your RL framework of choice (`gym`, `stable‑baselines3`, etc.)
- Required Datasets from Kaggle

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prk10/qml_meta-kaggle.git
cd qml_meta-kaggle
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Or install needed deps manually
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab  # or jupyter notebook
   ```

2. Open `qml-meta-kaggle.ipynb`.

3. Execute cells in sequence to replicate the analyses and visual outputs.

Results and visuals will be saved in the `visuals/` directory, aligning with the notebook's logic.

## Usage

- **Explore and learn Q‑learning workflows** using the existing notebook.
- **Re-run or tweak** the analysis with different hyperparameters, datasets, or reward structures.
- **Use visuals** in presentations or reports—like learning curves, state trajectories, or performance graphs.
- **Update the PDF report** to reflect new findings or extended experiments.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Some ideas:

- Add support to load and analyze additional Kaggle datasets.
- Extend the notebook with deeper RL techniques (e.g., double Q‑learning, DQN).
- Automate report generation from notebook outputs.
- Provide unit tests or continuous integration workflows for reproducibility.

Please follow standard GitHub flow: fork, branch, commit, open PR, and add context.
